# Dynamics Modeling and Analysis with Data (DyMAD)

This is the GitHub site for DyMAD, developed and maintained by the [APUS Lab at Penn State](https://apus-lab.github.io/).

This README is mainly for developer use.  For documentation, refer to [readthedocs.org](https://dymad.readthedocs.org).

# TODO notes

- Simplify YAML parsing with dict-based modifications
- Extend DynGeoData with subgraph to parallelize batch processing
- Include edge_attr etc in DynGeoData, see [here](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cheatsheet/gnn_cheatsheet.html)
